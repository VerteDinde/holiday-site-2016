# Holiday Site 2016

## Purpose
This is a side site I'm building to prepare for Code Fellows 301, testing my HTML and CSS knowledge and trying to play around with Javascript (specifically event listeners, which are brand new to me).

Eventually hoping to have a site designed similar to this one: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

## Fonts
